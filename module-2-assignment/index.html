			<p>Spiders are some of the hardest working wildlife in Maryland. Many people are fearful of spiders and often overlook the critical role they play controlling insect pests.  Knowing how to distinguish some of the different types of spiders and understanding the important functions that they serve in our environment can often lead to a greater appreciation of their beneficial qualities.</p>

			<h4 id="sec_2_header">Describe them</h4>
			<p>Spiders are classified as Arachnids. Other types of Arachnids include mites, ticks and harvestmen (aka “Daddy long-legs"). Spiders are different from other Arachnids because their body is divided into two major sections which are separated by a pedicel or narrow connection. The front part of the spider’s body is called the cephalothorax while the back is called the abdomen. Attached to the abdomen are finger-like appendages known as spinnerets. These structures are the silk-spinning organs and are often used for spider identification.
